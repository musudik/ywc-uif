# Client Creation Functionality

## Overview
The YWC platform now includes a comprehensive client creation interface that allows Coaches and Admins to create new client accounts with proper role-based access control and coach assignment.

## Access Control
- **COACH**: Can create clients that are automatically assigned to themselves
- **ADMIN**: Can create clients and manually assign them to any available coach
- **CLIENT**: Cannot access client creation functionality

## Features

### 1. Create Client Form (`/dashboard/clients/create`)
**Location**: `src/pages/clients/CreateClient.tsx`

**Form Fields**:
- First Name (required)
- Last Name (required)
- Email Address (required, validated)
- Password (required, min. 6 characters)
- Confirm Password (required, must match)
- Coach Assignment (automatic for coaches, manual selection for admins)

**Validation**:
- Email format validation
- Password strength (minimum 6 characters)
- Password confirmation matching
- Coach assignment validation
- Duplicate email prevention (handled by API)

### 2. Client Management Page (`/dashboard/clients`)
**Location**: `src/pages/clients/ClientManagement.tsx`

**Features**:
- Lists all clients (for admins) or assigned clients (for coaches)
- Client information display (name, email, type, join date)
- Quick actions (View, Edit profile)
- Empty state handling
- Real-time client data loading

### 3. Integration Points

#### Coach Dashboard
- "Add New Client" button in header
- Quick action tile for client creation
- Navigation to client management

#### Authentication Service
- `register()` method for creating new user accounts
- `getAllCoaches()` method for admin coach selection
- `getCoachClients()` method for listing assigned clients

## Technical Implementation

### Coach Assignment Logic
```typescript
// For COACH users - auto-assign to themselves
coach_id: user.id

// For ADMIN users - manual selection from dropdown
coach_id: selectedCoachId

// For CLIENT users - N/A (cannot create clients)
```

### API Integration
- Uses `authService.register()` for account creation
- Uses `authService.getAllCoaches()` for coach selection (admin only)
- Uses `authService.getCoachClients()` for client listing

### Role-Based UI
- **Coaches**: See auto-assignment notification, cannot change coach
- **Admins**: See coach selection dropdown with all available coaches
- **Clients**: No access to client creation functionality

## Navigation Flow
1. **Coach/Admin Dashboard** → "Add New Client" button
2. **Create Client Form** → Fill details → Submit
3. **Success** → Redirect to Client Management page
4. **Client Management** → View all clients with actions

## Error Handling
- Form validation with user-friendly messages
- API error handling with notification system
- Network error resilience
- Empty state handling

## Security Features
- Role-based access control via `RoleGuard`
- Proper coach-client relationship establishment
- Password security requirements
- Email validation and duplicate prevention

## Files Modified/Created
- `src/pages/clients/CreateClient.tsx` - Main creation form
- `src/pages/clients/ClientManagement.tsx` - Enhanced client listing
- `src/services/authService.ts` - Added `getAllCoaches()` method
- `src/routes/index.tsx` - Route configuration (already existed)
